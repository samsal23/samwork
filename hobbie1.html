        <h3>Festivals and Shows</h3>

        <p>My first hobby is attending festivals and shows for EDM music. I have a passion to listening to music as well as enjoy most genres. However, EDM is my favorite genre of music and is typically what I put on for most of the time. There’s something about it that always excites me when I hear some new songs or mixes. My favorite artist is Zeds Dead. I love to turn on his music or see him live. I went to my first festival in high school with a group of friends which was North Coast Music Festival in 2014. I remember it was at the end of summer, and I had worked all summer to save up for this. It ended up being unforgettable experience that I wish I can go back to.</p>
