<article> 
<p style="font-size:larger">Hello my name is Sam and my favorite thing to do with my free time is play video games. Ever since my uncle got me the first Xbox and the game Halo for it I've been obsessed. My brother and I would play against each other for hours. Eventually as games evolved and I grew up it became a hobbie of mine. However, I am very competitive and hate losing. Some games I like play are Pubg, Apex, and Far Cry.
There are different kinds of video games and genres. It's hard to pick a favorite because I like them all. Games like Apex which recently came out is a battle royal with teams of three. In the game Halo, you can play online for team vs team battle or objectives, and includes a campaign that is very fun. lastly, there are games that have no onlin, but you are free to roam around and play in your own univerise.
