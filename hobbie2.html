                    <h3>Going out with friends</h3>
I love to go out and have new experiences with my friends. Sometimes it can be going to the beach or tailgating with my friends. Being around my friends is always a good time since they’re always making me laugh. This is like a break from the world and any negativity. Sometimes I wish we never end up leaving each other at the end of the day. </p>
                    <p>However, one experience I will never forget is when me and 5 of my friends were all hanging out playing videogames while taking turns all sitting on one coach. It started unintentionally when I sat on my buddy’s coach with him to play video games. Then, as time passed another friend came along and joined us. Before we knew it was 7 P.M. and there was 5 grown man on one little coach taking turns playing video games. That day I knew that those guys were my friends forever.  </p>
