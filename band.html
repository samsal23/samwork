    <h3>Instead of three CD's I'm going to describe three of my favorite songs since they all came from the same CD</h3>
<d1>
    <dt><h4>1. Numb (my favorite): is about children who don't want to live up to their parents expetations anymore especially if their high</h4></dt>
    <dt><h4>2. Breaking the Habit: is a good song which is why I picked it but not relative to me. It's about someone who is in his room a lot. He also hurts themself and should break that habit</h4></dt>
    <dt><h4>3. In The End: which became a lot more meaningful after the lead singer killed himself. It was a song about depression and the struggles he had growing up. It's really sad that he made a song about trying to get past that but eventually passed.</h4></dt>
